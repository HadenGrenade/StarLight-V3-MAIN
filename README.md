I am giving everyone this shit beacuse i havent worked on it in over a year. It used to be a P2C, then i stopped updating it. I started this development
when i first started c++, so im obliged to tell you that the code is absolutley terrible consistently throughout the code, and i did use junk code for 'undetected means.'  Much of it is pasted and its NOT up to date. But i would say that wouldn't take longer than 30 minutes to fix with the IQ of a nazi.
I'd also like to mention that the cheat actually isn't that bad. Has a partially working ragebot a lot of features, nice visuals and a TON of misk options with a really good resolver (mainly for legitbot but either way its very good). The legitbots alright.
